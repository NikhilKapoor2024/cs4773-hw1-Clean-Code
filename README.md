# cs4773-hw1-Clean-Code

This was my first assignment for my Object Oriented Programming class for the Fall 2023 semester. Being given a program, we were tasked with rewriting the program
to adhere to OOP principles, including:
1. Rename local and instance variables in a way that communicates their context (this will involve you really understanding what the code is doing)
2. Avoid names that are confusing, misleading, or unhelpful
3. Decompose functions into smaller, specialized functions in terms of # of lines, focus, and indentation
4. No functions should have hidden side-effects
5. Use focused error handling
6. Minimize duplicated code (DRY)
